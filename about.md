I'm a programmer. I'm also a manager, and an experienced Agilist. As Managing Director of a [Neo](http://neo.com) office, I have also become a enthusiastic about the combination of Lean UX and Agile. I may write about that here.

This is my second attempt at a blog. I was reasonably prolific from about 2004 to 2008, then Twitter hit and I stopped blogging. That blog was entirely technical, largely because I started it shortly after a family tragedy and didn't want to write about that in public. I intend this to be more eclectic.

I tweet [here](https://twitter.com/paulanthonywils), and my Linked-in profile is [here](https://uk.linkedin.com/pub/paul-wilson/1/189/39b).
