title: Upgrade to correcthorsebatterystaple.com

A few years ago I wrote the [Correct Horse Battery Staple](http://correcthorsebatterystaple.com/) password generator app, inspired by [XKCD 936 (read it)](http://xkcd.com/936/). It's basic idea is that longer passwords consisting of words, are more memorable and stronger than more complex but shorter passwords.

I originally used the [General Service List](http://jbauman.com/aboutgsl.html) set of 2,284 words <em>selected to be of the greatest "general service" to learners of English</em>. Most criticism of the generator was about the small size of that list. I did try the Unix [words file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words_(Unix)), but the phrases formed were to strange to remember; there's a lot of odd words in that list.

Today I've updated it to use all the uncapitalised (to avoid names), whole words found in a few books from [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org): [The Thirty-Nine Steps](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/558), [Three Men in a Boat](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/308), [Ulysses](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4300), and [War and Peace (English translation)](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2600).

This has given us a pool of 26,626 words from which to choose, some of which are [quite interesting](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/phthisical) (and some down to Captain Denisov's speech impediment.)

Let [me know what you think](https://twitter.com/paulanthonywils). I'll make some more improvements later in the week.
