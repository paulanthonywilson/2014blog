title: New blog

I kept a blog from December 2004 to 2011. Up until 2008 (and Twitter) I wrote often, but only managed a few blog posts in the final few years. Now it's time to start again. I've decided to go with [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) hosted on [Linode](https://www.linode.com).  

It is pretty vanilla Jekyll right now, and obviously, needs some CSS love. I'm strangely reluctant to go with bootstrap.

I kept the last blog technical, or at least work-related. This time I am just going to see how it goes. I've already got some pages [here](/pages/stagecoach-mitchell) on the time that [Stagecoach buses](http://www.stagecoachbus.com) nearly killed me, but I'm pretty sure this isn't going to be an urban cycling blog.
