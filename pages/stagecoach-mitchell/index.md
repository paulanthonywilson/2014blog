On the 26 October 2012 I was cycling home when a stagecoach bus, driven by Andrew Mitchell, overtook me in a dangerous place. The rear of the bus clipped me, knocking me off my bike. Due to the speed at which I hit the tarmac, both my shoulders were broken.

At that time I did not cycle with a helmet-cam, but I do have CCTV stills from the bus, which captures a snapshot from each camera every second. This is what happened.
